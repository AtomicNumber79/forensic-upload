While trying to apply for Production stage for the Dropbox app, I needed to make the source code unavailable.  Once I get everything cleared up, the files will be uploaded again.

Forensic Upload is a way to transfer information gathered on one machine to another machine.  Specifically, this Python script will take command line output and upload it directly to a Dropbox account.  From the Dropbox account, a user can access the files to run a forensic analysis.

Please Note:
This script is in a very early stage of production.  The Dropbox app it connects with is still in Development stage.  Up to 100 people can test it in Development stage, but once it reaches Production stage this limitation will be removed.
